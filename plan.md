# Minesweeper

## Basics - What do I NEED

* Board - 10x10 Grid
    * Board cells start all identical
    * Upon clicking a board cell becomes either: 
        * Empty
        * Number representing number of bombs nearby
        * Bomb
    * Once a cell has been clicked if it is empty it should reveal all empty cells that it is adjacent to - not diagonal
